## Project Description

The **Heart Attack Prediction Project** aims to develop a predictive model using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** to assess the risk of heart disease in individuals based on various health metrics. This project is motivated by the need for early detection and preventive healthcare solutions to combat the increasing prevalence of heart disease globally.

### Objectives
- To create an accurate machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of heart attacks based on health-related features.
- To analyze the relationships between different health metrics and their impact on heart disease risk.
- To provide a user-friendly tool for healthcare professionals that can assist in patient assessment and decision-making.

### Features
The project utilizes a dataset containing a variety of health-related features, including but not limited to:
- **Age**: The age of the individual.
- **Sex**: Gender of the individual (0 = female; 1 = male).
- **Chest Pain Type (cp)**: Type of chest pain experienced.
- **Resting Blood Pressure**: Measured in mm Hg.
- **Serum Cholesterol**: Measured in mg/dl.
- **Fasting Blood Sugar**: Binary indicator (1 = true; 0 = false) for fasting blood sugar levels.
- **Resting Electrocardiographic Results**: Results of electrocardiographic tests.
- **Max Heart Rate Achieved**: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
- **Exercise Induced Angina**: Indicator of angina induced by exercise.
- **ST Depression**: ST depression relative to rest.
- **Slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
- **Number of Major Vessels**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
- **Thalassemia**: Indicates the presence of thalassemia (1 = normal; 0 = fixed; 2 = reversible).
- **Target**: Indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

### Methodology
The project follows a systematic approach:
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset is collected and preprocessed to ensure quality and completeness.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the data to understand the distribution and relationships among features.
3. **Model Development**: Designing and training the ANN model using Keras and TensorFlow.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Implementing k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

### Expected Outcomes
The final output of this project is a trained ANN model capable of accurately predicting the risk of heart attacks. Additionally, the project aims to provide insights into the importance of various health parameters in assessing heart disease risk, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and prevention strategies.

### Future Work
Future iterations of this project could explore:
- Integrating additional features or alternative datasets for improved model performance.
- Developing a web-based application for healthcare professionals to easily access predictions.
- Conducting further research on the impact of lifestyle changes on heart disease risk.
